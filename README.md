# detecteur-ia
A french pretrained classification model that aims to detect whether an input has been generated by a human or by a Large Language Model such as Chat-GPT or LLaMA.


This model is aimed to one day help educators verify if work is done by humans or not. The model will, by design, classify as human-made text that has been generated by AI but rewritten by a human. This is because its aim is to catch pure ai without any human input.


This model is based on [BARThez](https://huggingface.co/moussaKam/barthez). <br>
It is pretrained on a corpus of 15 000 of french articles that have been summarized by both humans and AI
